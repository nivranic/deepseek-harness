## Summary

Browser approval presentation over the Agent-scoped Remote Event waterfall. The plugin publishes each pending request through `ctx.uiSession`, takes over the Conversation composer, optionally renders correlated Tool detail, and returns the user's decision to the waiting Host request. Use it when a browser must collect approval for a waiting Host operation.

Beside the decision, the panel lists the section-38 facts — operation, host (from the connection's host facts), workspace, risk tier, permission-escalation reason, and the command-preview heading over the correlated Tool detail. Absent rows are hidden; the risk row appears only when the asker classified a tier.

## Model Experience

None, as this package presents approval requests in the browser and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; approval request and response rendering does not alter a model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The panel exposes transient decisions only** — it supports allow-once and reject; persistent permission policy remains owned by Host-side approval packages.
- **Fact rows follow the asker's data** — host and workspace resolve from client state and may stay hidden while the connection handshake or the workspace list is pending; the panel never invents placeholder values.
